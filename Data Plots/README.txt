*********************************DETECTION PLOTS LEGENDS**********************************
* Huge Grey Points refer to radar device location
* Cyan Points refer to true positions of detected targets
* Magenta Points refer to positions of undetected targets 
* Blue Points refer to the average of clustered detection data for a detected target
* Small Gray Points refer to clustered detection data for one second.

*************SINGLE-TARGET DETECTION POINT-BY-POINT CHARACTERIZATION CAPTIONS*************
* Accuracy changes Point Diameter: accuracy ranges from 0-to-3000 (good-to-bad) and point diameter from 50-to-1000 (good-to-bad)
* Sensitivity changes Transparency: sensitivity ranges from 0-to-1 (bad-to-good) and transparency from 0.2-to-1 (bad-to-good)
* Precision changes Color: precision ranges from 0-to-1 (bad-to-good) and color from magenta-to-cyan (bad-to-good)
* x points are cell points

NOTE: More Accurate, Smaller Diameter; More Sensitive, More Opaque; More Precise, Cooler Color
